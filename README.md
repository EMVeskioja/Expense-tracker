💰 Expense Tracker – RESTful API with Java & H2 Database
A simple, no-nonsense expense tracking API—built to solidify my RESTful CRUD + database skills and push my Spring Boot knowledge to the next level.

🎯 Why This Project?
I’m four months into my Java course, and this project is my trial-by-fire to:

✔ Master Spring Boot and RESTful API development
✔ Implement full CRUD functionality for expenses
✔ Work with relational databases (H2 for now, PostgreSQL later)
✔ Break things, fix them, and (hopefully) learn before breaking them again

📢 Once all endpoints are fixed, this repo will go public!

Also, let’s be real—I’m milking my free IntelliJ Ultimate while I can, because once that student license expires… it’s hello, open-source editors!

🏆 End goal? A solid portfolio → internship → job (or world domination, we’ll see).

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Java + Spring Boot
Database: H2 (for now, PostgreSQL later)
API Documentation: Swagger UI
Testing: JUnit + Mockito
IDE: IntelliJ Ultimate (before I’m forced back to VS Code)


📌 Features
✅ Already Working
✔ CRUD Operations – Add, edit, delete, and retrieve expenses
✔ Swagger UI – Auto-generated API documentation & testing
✔ H2 Console – Debugging directly in the browser
✔ Error Handling & Validations – Because crashing isn’t fun


🚧 Still Cooking
🔜 Authentication – JWT? Firebase? Magic? To be decided
🔜 PostgreSQL/MySQL Support – When I finally commit to a database
🔜 Better Exception Handling – Because I always forget something


⚡ API Endpoints Overview
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/expenses	Fetch all expenses
GET	/api/expenses/{id}	Get an expense by ID
POST	/api/expenses	Add a new expense
PUT	/api/expenses/{id}	Update an existing expense
DELETE	/api/expenses/{id}	Remove an expense


⚡ Progress So Far
✔ Backend CRUD working like a charm
✔ H2 Database up and running
✔ Swagger UI making life easier
❌ Authentication (coming soon™)
❌ Frontend (uhhh... maybe? Maybe not?)


💡 Lessons Learned So Far
📌 Spring Boot is magic… until you debug for hours.
📌 H2 is great for testing but would implode in production.
📌 Writing clean endpoints is easy—handling edge cases is a nightmare.
📌 Swagger saves time (and possibly my sanity).



🚀 Next Steps
🔹 Fix any broken endpoints & validate inputs properly
🔹 Implement authentication (JWT? Firebase? Witchcraft?)
🔹 Refactor code for better structure
🔹 Deploy (without breaking the entire thing)



🌟 Contributions & Feedback
This project will be public soon, and I’d love to hear your thoughts!

⭐ Star this repo if you think it’s cool—or just to support my IntelliJ dependency.



😂 Final Thoughts
If you’re still here, you’re either:

✅ Actually interested in my project (which means you have excellent taste, obviously)
✅ A recruiter scanning for red flags (I assure you, my exception handling is better than my life choices)
✅ Lost, confused, but too deep in now to back out (we ride at dawn)

Either way—glad to have you! 🚀 Stick around, watch me build cool stuff, and if this breaks in production… well, let’s just call that an immersive learning experience 😎.

And if nothing else, at least you can say you witnessed whatever this is unfold in real time. Exciting, right? Right??
