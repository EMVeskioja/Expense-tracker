💰 Expense Tracker – RESTful API with Java & H2 Database

🚀 A simple, no-nonsense expense tracking API—built to solidify my RESTful CRUD + database skills and push my Java Spring Boot knowledge further.



🎯 Why This Project?
I’m four months into my Java course, and this project helps me:

✔ Master Spring Boot & RESTful API development
✔ Implement full CRUD functionality on expenses
✔ Work with relational databases (H2 for now, PostgreSQL later)
✔ Break things, fix them, learn fast



📢 Once all endpoints are fixed, this repo goes public!



💡 Also, let’s be real—I’m maxing out my free IntelliJ Ultimate while I still can. Once my student status expires, VS Code it is.


👀 End goal? A solid portfolio → internship → job (hopefully!)



🛠️ Tech Stack
🔹 Backend: Java + Spring Boot
🔹 Database: H2 (in-memory for now, PostgreSQL later)
🔹 API Documentation: Swagger UI
🔹 Testing: JUnit + Mockito
🔹 IDE: IntelliJ Ultimate (before I go broke)



📌 Features
✅ Implemented
✔ CRUD Operations – Add, edit, delete, fetch expenses
✔ Swagger UI – Auto-generated API documentation & testing
✔ H2 Console – Inspect the database directly from the browser
✔ Error Handling & Validations – Prevent weird crashes

🚧 In Development
🔜 Authentication – Probably JWT (or Firebase, if I’m lazy)
🔜 PostgreSQL/MySQL Support – Once I finalize the schema
🔜 Better Exception Handling – Because I will forget a case




⚡ API Endpoints Overview
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/expenses	Fetch all expenses
GET	/api/expenses/{id}	Get expense by ID
POST	/api/expenses	Add a new expense
PUT	/api/expenses/{id}	Update an existing expense
DELETE	/api/expenses/{id}	Remove an expense
🛠 Swagger UI available at: /swagger-ui.html




⚡ Progress So Far
✔ Backend CRUD working
✔ H2 Database hooked up
✔ Swagger UI enabled
❌ Authentication (coming soon)
❌ Frontend (not sure if I’ll build one)




💡 Lessons Learned So Far
📌 Spring Boot is magic … until you debug for hours.
📌 H2 is amazing for testing but not great for production.
📌 Writing clean endpoints is easy … handling edge cases isn’t.
📌 Swagger is a lifesaver for API documentation.




🎯 Next Steps
🔹 Fix any broken endpoints & validate inputs properly
🔹 Implement authentication (JWT or Firebase)
🔹 Refactor code for better structure
🔹 Deploy (without breaking everything)

😂 Final Thoughts
If you’ve made it this far, you’re either:

✅ Actually interested in my project (Thanks, you’re awesome!)
✅ A recruiter skimming for red flags (Hi, I’m a fast learner!)
✅ Lost but vibing with the energy



Either way—welcome! 🚀
