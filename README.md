💰 Expense Tracker – RESTful API with Java & H2 Database



🚀 A simple, no-nonsense expense tracking API – built to solidify my RESTful CRUD + database skills.



🎯 Why This Project?


I'm currently four months into my Java course and using this project to:


✔ Master RESTful API development with Spring Boot
✔ Implement full CRUD functionality on expenses
✔ Work with relational databases using H2 (for now, might swap later) ✔ Break things, fix them, learn, repeat


It’s a work-in-progress, and once endpoints are fully fixed, this repo will be public!


💡 Also, let’s be real – I’m maxing out my sweet-sweet free IntelliJ Ultimate account while I still can. Once my student status expires, I’ll probably cry into my open-source editor.


End goal? Build a solid portfolio to land an internship or (if I’m lucky) a job!



🛠️ Tech Stack


🔹 Backend: Java + Spring Boot
🔹 Database: H2 (in-memory for now, might switch to PostgreSQL later)
🔹 API Documentation: Swagger UI
🔹 Authentication: TBD (maybe JWT?)
🔹 Testing: JUnit + Mockito
🔹 IDE: IntelliJ Ultimate (before I go broke)



📌 Features (Planned & Implemented)


✅ CRUD Operations – Add, edit, delete, and fetch expenses
✅ Swagger UI – API documentation & testing
✅ H2 Console – Debugging database directly in the browser
✅ Error Handling & Validations – No weird, unexpected crashes (hopefully)
🔜 User Authentication – Probably JWT or Firebase, depending on vibes
🔜 PostgreSQL / MySQL Support – Once I finalize the structure



🚀 Endpoints Overview


Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/expenses	Fetch all expenses
GET	/api/expenses/{id}	Get expense by ID
POST	/api/expenses	Add a new expense
PUT	/api/expenses/{id}	Update an existing expense
DELETE	/api/expenses/{id}	Remove an expense
🛠 Swagger UI available at: /swagger-ui.html



⚡ Current Progress


✔ Backend CRUD working
✔ H2 Database hooked up
✔ Swagger UI enabled
❌ Authentication (soon™)
❌ Frontend (maybe React? Maybe not?)



💡 Lessons Learned So Far


Spring Boot is magic. Until it isn’t, and then you debug for hours.
H2 is fantastic for testing but probably not ideal for production.
Writing clean endpoints is easy. Handling edge cases & errors? Not so much.
Swagger is a lifesaver.



🎯 Next Steps


🔹 Fix any broken endpoints & validate inputs properly
🔹 Add authentication (probably JWT?)
🔹 Refactor code for better structure & efficiency
🔹 Deploy (if I don’t break everything first)

😂 Final Thoughts
If you’ve made it this far, you’re either:
✅ Actually interested in my project (thanks, you're awesome!)
✅ A recruiter skimming for red flags
✅ Lost and confused but vibing with the energy


Either way, welcome! 😆
